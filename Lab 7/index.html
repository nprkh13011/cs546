            <h2>~ Biography ~</h2>
            <p>Hello, hello! My name's Nidhi, and I am a 3/5 Computer Science major at Stevens Institute of Technology.
            If you're looking for an interesting story about myself, you came to the wrong place... 
            Instead, you'll be reading a bunch of stuff that doesn't really have significance or rather just my train of thoughts.
            That reminds me of a quote from the famous Michael Scott, “Sometimes I'll start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going. 
            I just hope I find it along the way.” 
            </p>
            <p>
            If you really want to hear this FANTASTICAL life of mine, here it is....
            I haven't really gotten experience to the life of code until my freshman year of college,
            where I was first introduced to Python. I personally prefer Python over Java, but while taking this class,
            I realized I might like Javascript a little more. Maybe, we'll see. I've been excited to take this class for a while
            and I am happy to be learning a lot from this class! 
            </p>
