        <h1>The Story with Hades and Persephone</h1>
            <p> --This is one of my favorite stories in Greek Mythology-- </p>
            <p>Demeter went to supervise her bountiful crops.
            As Persephone engaged in play and with the rest of the group, her attention fell upon the potently fragrant valley nearby and she couldn’t take her eyes of the yellow flower narcissus.
            She called upon her playmates to accompany her, but they couldn’t possibly go with her as leaving the side of their water bodies would result in their death.
            The flower Narcissus was planted there by Gaia, who was following the orders of Zeus. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The goal was to enchant Persephone and attract her, away from her guides.
            Persephone danced her way to the garden alone and tried to pluck the narcissus from the bosom of Gaia. 
            It drained her energies as the narcissus only came out after a lot of pulling.
            But suddenly, to her utter fright, she saw the tiny hole from which she had drawn out the flower shaft, began to rapid grow in size until it started to resemble a mighty enormous chasm.

            <p>
            From this came the vigorous galloping sounds of multiple horses and such sudden happenings only froze the frail beauty to her feet.
            Demeter rushed back to where she had left her daughter and found only the Cyane river there with the other nymphs weeping.
            Worried as she was, she asked all as to the whereabouts of her beloved daughter. 
            Nobody could tell her anything at all and furious that they couldn’t protect her child, she cursed all the nymphs into becoming heinous women with plumed bodies and scaly feet, called the sirens.

            <p>
            It was only the river Cyane who helped her by washing over the belt of Persephone, indicating that something gravely wrong had happened.
            Demeter went mad and hunted for her daughter everywhere. The myth says that she even disguised herself as an aged lady and with lighted torched in her hands roamed the Earth for nine long days and nine long nights.
            Finally, she met Hekate, the deity of magic, witchcraft, spirits and crossroads, at the dawn of the 10th day who had pity at her dismal condition and asked her to seek help from the all seeing Helios, the sun god. 
            Helios told Demeter all about how Hades had dragged Persephone into the underworld.
